# JChat
A simple chatting program made in Java, implemented with the use of TCP to ensure the sending/delivering of messages from users.

## Why I made the project:
Everytime I learn a programming language, the first I like to know is: *How do I send messages over the internet?* We use the internet everyday (and in almost every piece of software we make) so it is pretty important to know how to send messages over TCP or UDP in whatever language you wish to use. I used this project to become familiar with TCP in Java and I later used this knowledge in my **GubaGame** and **MouseDroid** projects.
